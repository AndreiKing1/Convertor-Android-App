# Convertor-Android-App
My Android app built in Java using Android Studio for converting units across categories like length, weight, volume, speed, and data. Features include user authentication, conversion history, and an animated splash screen. Supports various conversions (e.g., meters to centimeters, kilograms to pounds) and uses SQLite for data storage.
